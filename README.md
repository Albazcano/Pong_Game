# Pong_Game

Hello World! This is a simple game to start practicing with the Java language. The coding of this 
game was very simple. It uses Java Swing and AWT, as you can see most of my other projects use. 

# To run
Go to the folder under bin. Also make sure you have Java installed and JAVA_HOME set in your environment variables. Then run:
```
java main.Main
 ```
 and play to your heart's content.
